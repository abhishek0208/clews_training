==========================================================================

Learning objectives:
By the end of this session participants will be able to:
* Define technologies and commodities 
* Define model structure and 
* Define basic technical characteristics of energy technologies
* Define capital, fixed and variable costs in relation to energy technologies;
* Investigate the impact capital, fixed and variable costs have on results such as the annual energy production by technology;
* Define discount rate and the impact it has on future costs in the model;
* Explain accumulated annual demand; and
* Investigate the impact changes in accumulated annual demand have on the model outputs including annual energy produced by each technology.
