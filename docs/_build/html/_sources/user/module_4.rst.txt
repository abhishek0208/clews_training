Module 4: Modelling interlinkages in CLEWs models
=================================================

Learning objectives:
By the end of this session participants will be able to:
•	Define key interlinkages in CLEWs systems
•	Define scenarios to explore interlinkages
•	Assess inter-sectoral impacts, trade-offs and synergies with CLEWs models
